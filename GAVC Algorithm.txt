Simple Algorithm Premise:
-------------------------
There exists 2 vectors. One is named the "Stimulus Vector", and one is named the "Frame Vector". The Stimulus vector
is a one dimensional vector whose N elements are Tensors of rank 1. The Frame vector is a vector whose N elements are
Tensors of rank 2. In vector terms, the Stimulus vector is made up of N vectors whose length are 1 and the Frame vector
is made up of N vectors whose length is variable.

We may then postulate that there exists a Tensor of rank 3 called the Compression Operator that maps the N elements of both
the Stimulus and Frame vectors together element-wise. The Genetic Algorithm's goal is to generate the Compression Operator.

Finally, the ultimate goal is for the algorithm to iteratively generate Compression Operators over precedent Compression
Operators using the same schema. Once the algorithm generates a Compression Operator, that Compression Operator is loaded
into the Frame Vector and the algorithm runs again. In this way, large data masses can be compressed into smaller and smaller
data masses.

Tools
-----
Python will be used for the initial implementation. It was chosen because it has good APIs for Tensorflow. Tensorflow was
chosen after doing research on the best way to work with matrix and Tensor computation on the GPU.
